It has 24 levels, and you can quickly see the results.@media(min-width:0px){#div-gpt-ad-daily\_dev\_tips\_com-box-4-0-asloaded{max-width:336px!important;max-height:280px!important}}if(typeof ez\_ad\_units!='undefined'){ez\_ad\_units.push(\[\[336,280\],'daily\_dev\_tips\_com-box-4','ezslot\_4',188,'0','0'\])};\_\_ez\_fad\_position('div-gpt-ad-daily\_dev\_tips\_com-box-4-0');
